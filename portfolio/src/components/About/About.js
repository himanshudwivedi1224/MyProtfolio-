      <p>
        I am a passionate Full-Stack Developer with a proven track record of designing, developing, and deploying robust and scalable software solutions. With hands-on experience in C#, .NET Core, Angular, React, and cloud technologies like Azure, I have successfully contributed to the entire software development lifecycle, from concept to deployment.

        My experience includes leading the migration of monolithic architectures to microservices, resulting in a 30% reduction in downtime, and designing and optimizing microservices architecture to handle over 1 million requests per day. I am adept at collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality products that meet business objectives and drive user engagement.
